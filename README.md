## Note!
In this **six hour test**, you will need to use **AJAX** and a local JSON file. The CORS policy in the browser prevents this for security reasons. To get rid of this, a simple http server can be run locally with **node.js**. You should have already installed Node.js. If you haven't installed it, install node.js first. Then run the following commands from the node.js command line:

1. To install the browser-sync plugin: **npm install -g browser-sync**
2. Enter the folder you created to start the http server: **cd c:\my-web-app**
3. To start http server: **browser-sync start --server --directory --files "*"**

### html, css, js, json, &amp; ajax

Of course, there are other ways besides the above method. It varies from browser to browser. If you disable the **CORS policy** any other way it will work too.
